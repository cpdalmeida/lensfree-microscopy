#### Research Codes – Camila D’Almeida (PhD Thesis) ####



This repository contains the computer programs developed and used in my doctoral research, as presented in my thesis:

**Camila D’Almeida, “Development of lens-free holographic microscopes using multiheight and multispectral phase recovery methods” (University of São Paulo, 2023).***



## Overview

The codes correspond to the annexes of the thesis and were primarily written in Python. They are intended to support:

- Control and automation of experimental devices
- Processing and analysis of lens-free microscope images
- Implementation of **Multiheight** and **Multispectral** phase recovery techniques


## Repository Contents

- Python scripts included in the thesis annexes:
  - Annex_A_Multiheight_PhaseRecovery;
  - Annex_B_Device_control_Multiheight_Method;
  - Annex_C_Multispectral_PhaseRecovery;
  - Annex_D_Device_control_Multispectral_Method,


## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install the required Python libraries (see each script)
3. Follow instructions within each script to run the code


## License

These codes are shared for academic and research purposes only. Please cite the thesis when using or adapting them.
